# Unhandled Error in Swift async/await Task

This repository demonstrates a common error when using async/await in Swift within a `Task`.  The example code attempts to fetch data asynchronously but doesn't handle potential errors gracefully, resulting in a potential crash or unexpected behavior. The solution provides improved error handling, preventing the application from crashing.
